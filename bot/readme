the basics of the algo:
data for sma calculation is captured from the public api endpoint: https://api-pub.bitfinex.com/v2/candles/trade:5m:tBTCUSD/hist
This trading bot creates two sma lines: a 21 candle and 100 candle on the 5 minute candle chart
The bot finds the difference between these sma values sma_21 - sma_100
if the difference is positve:
  trend is positve and given other conditions (specified in code)
  authenticate and make a long trade
else
  short, given other conditions (specified in code)

the code lies within a timer which fetches ticker data every two seconds
